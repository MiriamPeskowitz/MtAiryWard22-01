# Website prototype for Mt Airy Ward 22-01
## Description
A website for a political ward, and its Committee Person. This began as a site for a campaign, and will become a site for the Ward itself, to do civic education and be a place to gather our elected officials and info about how to contact them. It will also give info about how to help with Get Out the Vote, for primaries and the general election.
